# An Example Flask App

This example flask app takes in some data and then displays it back to the user.
The data is saved to the database with the timestamp.
A second route shows the full set of text that was sent back and it's time stamp, more or less showing the database table.

Tools used:

Flask: sudo pip install Flask
SQLAlchemy: sudo pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

to start the application simple run:

python run.py
